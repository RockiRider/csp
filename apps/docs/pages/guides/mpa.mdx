# MPA
This plugin currently does not support Multi Page Applications (MPAs) and this is unlikely to change due to the nature of how MPAs interact with Vite.

<Callout type="info">
Examples of MPA frameworks include Nuxt.js, Remix, etc.
</Callout>

Since MPAs typically have access to a server, you should use a nonce-based CSP. We recommend checking if your MPA framework has built-in nonce support or solutions tailored to MPAs. If not, you can create a custom solution by following these rules:

## Rules to Follow
**On every page request:**
1. Generate a new [nonce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce).
2. Add the nonce to the [CSP header or meta](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).
3. Add the nonce to the script/style tags.

<Callout type="info">
Individual frameworks like Remix and Nuxt may be coming out with their own solutions soon, as [Vite recently added support for nonces.](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features#content-security-policy-csp)
