# MPA
This plugin currently does not support Multi Page Applications (MPA). 

Its something that I did try to implement but it was not possible due to the nature of how MPA's work.

I would recommened looking at your MPA framework and seeing if they have any nonce support, if not you could create a solution that works for your MPA. You just need to follow these rules:

### On every page request you should:
- Generate a new [nonce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce)
- Add the nonce to the [CSP header or meta] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
- Add the nonce to the script/style tags

Individual frameworks like Remix and Nuxt could be coming out with their own solutions soon, due to [Vite adding in support for nonces recently.](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features#content-security-policy-csp)
