# Creating your policy

This will hopefully help you build your CSP policy.


## Default Policies
We do this so you don't have to worry about the basics. These are merged with your custom policies.

```ts
"default-src": ["'self'"],
"img-src": ["'self'", "data:"],
"script-src-elem": ["'self'"],
"style-src-elem": ["'self'"],
```

## Typical use cases

#### Third party javascript

Third party code like, Google Analytics, Hotjar, etc. are common in most websites. You can use the `script-src` directive to allow these scripts to run.

<Callout type="warning">
    When doing this you are essentially trusting third party code to run on your website. Make sure you trust the third party and that they are not compromised.
</Callout>

```ts

import { defineConfig, PluginOption } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import csp from "vite-plugin-csp-guard";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    csp({
        policy: {
            "script-src": ["https://www.google-analytics.com"],
        }
    }),
  ],
});

```
<Callout type="info">
    Targetting a specific domain is a good way to ensure that only scripts from that domain are allowed to run. Sometimes its even better to be more specific and target a specific path on that domain, aslong as the path is unique and constant.
</Callout>

#### Third party css
Third party styles, that are injected at runtime are also common in most websites. You can use the `style-src` directive to allow these styles to be applied.


```ts

import { defineConfig, PluginOption } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import csp from "vite-plugin-csp-guard";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    csp({
        policy: {
            "style-src": ["https://example.com/styles/main.css"],
        }
    }),
  ],
});

```
