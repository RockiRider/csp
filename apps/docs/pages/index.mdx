Introducing the **Vite Plugin Hash CSP**, your ultimate solution for effortlessly implementing a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) in your Vite-powered Single Page Application (SPA). CSPs are crucial for protecting your site against XSS attacks, but setting them up correctly can be complex and time-consuming. Our plugin eliminates these challenges with a straightforward, effective approach.

## Why Choose Vite Plugin Hash CSP?

- **Effortless Integration**: Simply declare your CSP inside your `vite.config.ts` file and you're ready to go. No complex setup, no hassle.
- **Automated Hashing**: Unlike traditional methods that rely on nonces (which aren't feasible for SPAs), our plugin hashes all your code at build time when neccessary.
- **Real-Time CSP Validation**: Avoid the risk of shipping code that gets blocked in production. Our plugin runs your CSP in Vite dev mode, providing immediate feedback and ensuring your CSP policies are correct before deployment.
- **Designed for SPAs**: Tailored specifically for Single Page Applications, our plugin addresses the unique challenges they present.
