# Vite Plugin Hash CSP
This is a **Vite plugin** that lets you quickly add a Content Security Policy (CSP) to your Vite project. Whilst CSPs are a great way to protect your site from XSS attacks, they can be a pain to set up correctly and maintain. 
This plugin aims to solve these pain points.


## Getting Started

We have 2 seperate guides for Single Page Applications (SPA) and Multi Page Applications (MPA). Choose the one that best fits your project.

<Cards>
  <Card title="SPA" href="/guides/spa" />
  <Card title="MPA" href="/guides/mpa" />
</Cards>
