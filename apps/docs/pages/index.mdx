Introducing the **Vite Plugin Hash CSP**, your ultimate solution for effortlessly implementing a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) in your Vite-powered Single Page Application (SPA). CSPs are crucial for protecting your site against XSS attacks, but setting them up correctly can be complex and time-consuming. Our plugin eliminates these challenges with a straightforward, effective approach.

## Why Choose Vite Plugin Hash CSP?

- **Effortless Integration**: Simply declare your CSP inside your `vite.config.ts` file and you're ready to go. No complex setup, no hassle.
- **Automated Hashing**: Unlike traditional methods that rely on nonces (which aren't feasible for SPAs), our plugin hashes all your code at build time, ensuring your CSP is always up-to-date and secure.
- **Real-Time CSP Validation**: Avoid the risk of shipping code that gets blocked in production. Our plugin runs your CSP in Vite dev mode, providing immediate feedback and ensuring your CSP policies are correct before deployment.
- **Designed for SPAs**: Tailored specifically for Single Page Applications, our plugin addresses the unique challenges they present.

## Advice for Multi Page Applications (MPAs)

While our plugin is specifically designed for Single Page Applications (SPAs) and does not support Multi Page Applications (MPAs) due to architectural differences, we understand that developers may still need guidance for implementing CSPs in MPAs. Here are some recommendations:

- **Custom Implementation**: Consider implementing a custom CSP solution for each page within your MPA. This allows for more granular control over the security policies specific to each page's needs.
- **Server-Side CSP Management**: Use server-side middleware or frameworks that support CSP header generation and management. This can simplify the process and ensure consistent CSP application across all pages.
- **Separate Packages**: Explore separate packages or tools tailored for MPAs. These tools can provide more flexibility and control over CSPs in a multi-page context.
